# MAECK - Multimodal Alcohol Enjoyer and Company Keeper
### intelligent interactive systems 5 credit project.

## Introduction
Welcome to MAECK, an advanced, interactive system designed to replicate the bartender-customer interaction experience in a virtual environment. Our primary goal is to create a virtual bartender that closely mirrors the real-life experience. MAECK is developed on the furhat platform. We have integrated a facial recognision component using the py-feat library and created our machine learning model for emotion detection. The interactions are powered by a combination of rule-based system and an LLM.
